# shortURL - Cloudflare Workers URL Shortener

A production-focused URL shortener built on Cloudflare Workers, KV storage, and Durable Objects. It provides a password-protected dashboard, REST API, and lightweight analytics for redirect usage.

## Features
- Shorten URLs with optional human-readable descriptions
- Track redirect counts and last access times using a Durable Object counter
- Optional 30-day expiration per link; permanent links remain until removed
- Search previously created links by description and browse recent activity
- CORS-enabled REST API plus a responsive web UI for internal operators

## Architecture
- **Worker**: Handles the HTTP surface area (API, UI pages, redirects)
- **KV Namespace (`URLS`)**: Stores the canonical short URL records
- **Durable Object (`RedirectCounter`)**: Provides strongly consistent redirect counters
- **Wrangler**: Builds, runs, and deploys the worker, KV, and Durable Object bindings

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Generate KV namespaces (production + preview) if you have not already:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler kv:namespace create "URLS"
   npx wrangler kv:namespace create "URLS" --preview
   ```
3. Apply the Durable Object migration before the first deploy:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir=dist
   # verify the plan includes the RedirectCounter migration
   ```
4. Start local development in a Miniflare-like environment:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing
Run the Vitest suite (includes Cloudflare test harness and Durable Object runner):
```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment
Deploy to Cloudflare Workers (runs pending migrations automatically):
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## REST API Reference
- **POST `/api/urls`** – Create a new short URL. Body supports `url`, optional `description`, and optional `expirationType` (`"permanent"` or `"30days"`).
- **GET `/api/urls`** – List recent URLs. Accepts `limit` (defaults to 50, capped at 1000) and `cursor` for pagination.
- **GET `/api/urls/search?q=term`** – Case-insensitive description search. Returns `scanLimitHit` when the server stops scanning additional records.
- **GET `/api/urls/stats?code=abc123`** – Retrieve redirect metrics, creation time, and expiration metadata for a specific code.
- **GET `/{shortCode}`** – Redirect to the original URL, or return `410 Gone` if the link is expired.

## Operational Notes
- The worker automatically resets Durable Object counters when a short code is created or expires, so recycled codes never inherit stale metrics.
- Redirect counters update through a Durable Object to avoid KV race conditions under concurrency.
- Expired links are filtered from API responses and deleted on demand when a redirect is attempted.

## Contributing
- Keep TypeScript changes ASCII-only unless Unicode is required for user-visible text.
- Run `npm test` before submitting patches to ensure Workers + Durable Object logic still passes the harness.
- Update `agents.md` whenever operational responsibilities change.
